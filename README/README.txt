FILTERING OPTIONS
-----------------
- Exclude short anonymized segments:
  Segments with fewer than N words that were anonymized can be excluded
  from the output to reduce noise.

- Exclude heavily anonymized from TM:
  If more than X% of a segment is anonymized (default 50%, configurable),
  the target is cleared so it is not imported into memoQ's translation memory.
  Both source and target are always processed.
